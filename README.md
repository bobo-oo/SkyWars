# SkyWars
A game named **Sky Wars** was created using the programme. The goal of this two-player game is to obliterate each other's spacecraft. Each participant in the game has a fleet of spacecraft, which are all placed on a grid of squares. The players alternately fire at each other's ships until one player has obliterated every ship owned by the other player. <br/>

The Master Space Ship appears in one of the grid's squares at the beginning of the game at random. The Master Space Ship has the ability to move to any of its surrounding squares, and the square it chooses to travel to is selected at random from all those that are available. There is a one in three possibility that an enemy space ship will enter the sky whenever the Master Space Ship moves. There are three different sorts of enemy spaceships: BattleStar, BattleCruiser, and BattleShooter. The type of hostile spacecraft is absolutely arbitrary.
